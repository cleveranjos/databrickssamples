| Open your tenant home  | Today's businesses require real-time data delivery and low-code data transformations for strategic initiatives. This involves onboarding data from various sources, transforming it with best-practice architectures, and using push-down SQL to leverage scalable cloud data platforms like Databricks. In this demo, I will guide you through a SaaS-based data transformation pipeline, from source to dashboard, highlighting its flexibility and automation capabilities. I will demonstrate how Qlik provides an end-to-end solution within a single platform, enabling organizations to create and manage data pipelines using the Databricks Data Platform. Specifically, I will show how to use a movies database to build a medallion architecture on Databricks, making it AI-ready. |
